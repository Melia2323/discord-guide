# Basic Discord User Guides/Wikis

This project is the creation of two basic user guides/wikis regarding how to use Discord on two different devices: a Windows personal computer and an Android phone. It will help users unfamiliar with Discord to:
* understand what Discord is
* join a Discord community
* use basic functions of the Discord app to communicate with others 

These guides are intended to be tailored to the needs of a specific Discord community and may be modified as users request additional help items be added.
